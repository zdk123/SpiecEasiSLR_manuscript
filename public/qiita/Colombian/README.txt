Gut microbiota is associated with obesity and cardiometabolic disease in a population in the midst of Westernization - ID 11993
Gut microbiota of adult Colombians
Abstract

Westernization and its accompanying epidemiological transitions are associated with changes in gut microbiota. While the extremes of this lifestyle spectrum have been compared (hunter-gatherers, industrialized countries), populations undergoing such shifts have received little attention. To fill the gap of knowledge about the microbiome evolution following broad lifestyle changes and the emergence of disease-associated dysbiosis, we performed a cross-sectional study in which we characterized the microbiota of 441 Colombian adults through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and determined its relationship with demographic, health-related and dietary parameters. We showed that in the gut microbiota of this cohort thrive taxa proper of both hunter-gatherers (Prevotella, Treponema) and citizens of industrialized countries (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Barnesiella); the relative abundances of these taxa differed from those in Western and non-Western populations. We also showed that the Colombian gut microbiota is composed of five consortia of co-abundant microorganisms that are differentially associated with lifestyle, obesity and cardiometabolic disease, and highlighted metabolic pathways that might explain associations between microbiota and host health. Our results give insights into the evolution of the gut microbiota, and underscore the importance of this community to human health. Promoting the growth of specific microbial consortia could help ameliorating physiological conditions associated with Western lifestyles. See https://github.com/jsescobar/westernization
