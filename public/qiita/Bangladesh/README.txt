Abstract

The collection of fecal samples in prospective cohort studies is essential to provide the opportunity to study the effect of the human microbiota on numerous health conditions. However, these collection methods have not been adequately tested in low- and middle-income countries. We present estimates of technical reproducibility, stability at ambient temperature for 4 days, and accuracy comparing a "gold standard" for fecal samples in no solution, 95% ethanol, RNAlater, postdevelopment fecal occult blood test cards, and fecal immunochemical test tubes in a study conducted in Bangladesh. Fecal occult blood test cards and fecal samples stored in 95% ethanol or RNAlater adequately preserve fecal samples in this setting. Therefore, new studies in low- and middle-income countries should include collection of fecal samples using fecal occult blood test cards, 95% ethanol, or RNAlater for prospective cohort studies.
