Antibiotics, birth mode, and diet shape microbiome maturation during early life - ID 10249

Abstract

Early childhood is a critical stage for the foundation and development of both the microbiome and host. Early-life antibiotic exposures, cesarean section, and formula feeding could disrupt microbiome establishment and adversely affect health later in life. We profiled microbial development during the first two years of life in a cohort of 43 US infants, and identify multiple disturbances associated with antibiotic exposures, cesarean section, and diet. Antibiotics delayed microbiome development and suppressed Clostridiales, including Lachnospiraceae. Cesarean section led to depleted Bacteroidetes populations, altering establishment of maternal bacteria. Formula-feeding was associated with age-dependent diversity deviations. These findings illustrate the complexity of early-life microbiome development, and microbiota disturbances with antibiotic use, cesarean section, and formula feeding that may contribute to obesity, asthma, and other disorders.
