nfluence of Donor Human Milk versus Formula on the Microbiota of Late Preterm Infants - ID 11158
SG_B0009
Abstract

Background: Donor human milk (DHM), unlike formula, contains human milk oligosaccharides that act as prebiotics to help shape the gut microbiome. DHM is not routinely used in late preterm infants (LPIs, born between 34-36 6/7 weeks gestation) who are at risk for an unhealthy gut microbiome. Objective: Describe differences in the microbiome and clinical outcomes of LPIs fed donor human milk compared to infants exposed to formula early in life. Methods: LPIs were randomized to DHM or formula to supplement maternal breastmilk (MBM). Block randomization was by gestational age and delivery mode. Oral, skin, and stool samples were obtained daily until discharge to analyze the microbiome. Major clinical outcomes included length of stay (LOS), weight gain, and feeding tolerance were recorded. Results: Pending
