An exploration of Prevotella-rich microbiomes in HIV and men who have sex with men - ID 11914
Prevotella-rich microbiomes in HIV and MSM
Abstract

Gut microbiome characteristics associated with HIV infection are of intense research interest but a deep understanding has been challenged by confounding factors across studied populations. Notably, a Prevotella-rich enterotype described in HIV-infected populations is now understood to be common in men who have sex with men (MSM) regardless of HIV status, but driving factors and potential health implications are unknown. Here we further define the MSM-associated gut microbiome and describe compositional differences between the fecal microbiomes of Prevotella-rich MSM and non-MSM that may underlie observed pro-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, we show relatively subtle gut microbiome changes in HIV infection in MSM and women that include an increase in potential pathogens that is ameliorated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Lastly, using a longitudinal cohort, we describe microbiome changes that happen after ART initiation. This study provides an in-depth characterization of microbiome differences that occur in a US population infected with HIV and demonstrates the degree to which these differences may be driven by lifestyle factors, ART and HIV infection itself. Understanding microbiome compositions that occur with sexual behaviors that are high-risk for acquiring HIV and untreated and ART treated HIV infection will guide the investigation of immune and metabolic functional implications to ultimately target the microbiome therapeutically.
