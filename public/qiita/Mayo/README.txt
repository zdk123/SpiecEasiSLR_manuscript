MayoFSSII - fecal only
Abstract

To evaluate fecal collection methods for 16S rRNA gene sequencing,we determined technical reproducibility,stability at ambient temperature over a period of four days,and accuracy of five fecal collection methods (no additive,95% ethanol,RNAlater,fecal occult blood test,and fecal immunochemical test) using samples collected from 52 healthy volunteers at the Mayo Clinic in 2014.
