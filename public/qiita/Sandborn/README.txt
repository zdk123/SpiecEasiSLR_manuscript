Abstract

Because of the known contribution of the microbiota in IBD pathogenesis, we hypothesize that the patients’ microbiome and metabolome “bioprofiles” will reflect their genetic and transcriptional profiles that together predict their response to medication. The Specific Aims are: (1) to characterize these bioprofiles in extensively phenotyped patients with IBD and (2) toassess the capacity of these bioprofiles to predict disease severity and response to therapy. Accomplishmentof these Aims will be a necessary first step in the development of a Precision Gastroenterology approach that tailors IBD diagnosis and management to complete biological profiles (genes, microbiome, host and microbial transcriptome and metaboliites).
