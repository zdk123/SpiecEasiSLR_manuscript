Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome (V35) - ID 1928
HMP_V35, Human Microbiome Project
Abstract

This HMP production phase represents pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from multiple body sites across hundreds of human subjects. There are two time points represented for a subset of these subjects. Using default protocol v4.2., data for the 16S window spanning V3-V5 was generated for all samples, with a second 16S window spanning V1-V3 generated for a majority of the samples. 16S rRNA sequencing is being used to characterize the complexity of microbial communities at individual body sites, and to determine whether there is a core microbiome at each site. Several body sites will be studied, including the gastrointestinal and female urogenital tracts, oral cavity, nasal and pharyngeal tract, and skin.
